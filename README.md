**Methodology**

1. **_superhost-classifier_**:  A predictive model designed to forecast whether a host will achieve Superhost status based on their listing history.
   This code analyzes past performance and various metrics to determine the likelihood of a host meeting the criteria for Superhost recognition.
2. **_superhost-loss-classifier_**: A predictive model designed to forecast whether a host will lose Superhost status based on their listing history.
   This code analyzes past performance and various metrics to determine the likelihood of a host meeting the criteria for Superhost recognition.
3. **_overall-rating_**: employs linear and backward linear regression models to identify key factors that significantly influence achieving a high
   overall rating. This approach allows for a detailed understanding of which variables most strongly impact a listing's success in terms of guest satisfaction.
